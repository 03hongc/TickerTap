# Developer Manual ‚Äì TickerTap

Welcome to the TickerTap Developer Manual. This guide will help you get the application up and running locally, understand the API structure, and continue development smoothly.

## üõ† Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Supabase account + project
- Vercel account (for deployment)

### 1. Clone the repository

SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url

SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

### 3. Deployment

We use Vercel for deployment. This project is automatically deployed when code is pushed to the main branch.

To manually deploy:

Go to https://vercel.com

Connect your GitHub repository

Set the environment variables in Vercel under Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

Click Deploy

### API References

---

#### `POST /api/saveTicker`

**Description**: Saves a stock ticker to Supabase.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Ensure your Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies allow both `anon` and `public` roles to `INSERT` and optionally `SELECT` on the `ticker` table.

---

#### `GET /api/getTickers`

**Description**: Retrieves the most recently searched tickers from Supabase.

---

### External APIs Used

---

#### üìà Financial Modeling Prep API

- **URL**: [https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/](https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/)
- **Usage**:
  - Fetches financial data such as P/E ratio, revenue, and earnings growth
  - Called from the frontend to display company metrics on the analysis page

---

#### üì∞ NewsAPI

- **URL**: [https://newsapi.org/v2/everything](https://newsapi.org/v2/everything)
- **Usage**:
  - Retrieves news articles related to a given ticker
  - Used for basic sentiment analysis (positive, neutral, negative)

### Known Bugs

Supabase RLS policies must be configured correctly or inserts/selects may silently fail.

Some edge cases for invalid ticker input are not handled.

Rate limits may apply if Financial Modeling Prep API is added later

Recently searched tickers:
   Are not user-specific
   Do not update to show only the most recent if the same ticker is entered again
   Do not filter out invalid tickers

### Roadmap
- Add user authentication via Supabase Auth
- Implement ticker deletion feature
- Improve error messages and frontend validation
- Add tests for backend API routes
- Show sentiment and technical trend visualizations
- Add loading states and UX improvements
